Go make yourself some friends or you\'ll be lonely.
Once I was seven years old.

It was a big big world, but we thought we were bigger.
Pushing each other to the limits, we were learning quicker.
By eleven smoking herb and drinking burning liquor
Never rich so we were out to make that steady figure

Once I was eleven years old, my daddy told me
Go get yourself a wife or you\'ll be lonely.
Once I was eleven years old.

I always had that dream like my daddy before me
So I started writing songs, I started writing stories
Something about the glory, just always seemed to bore me
Cause only those I really love will ever really know me

Once I was twenty years old, my story got told
Before the morning sun, when life was lonely.
Once I was twenty years old.

I only see my goals, I don\'t believe in failure.
Cause I know the smallest voices, they can make it major.
I got my boys with me atleast those in favor
And if we don\'t meet before I leave, I hope I\'ll see you later.

Once I was 20 years old, my story got told
I was writing about everything, I saw before me
Once I was 20 years old.

Soon we\'ll be 30 years old, our songs have been sold
We\'ve traveled around the world and we\'re still roaming.
Soon we\'ll be 30 years old.

I\'m still learning about life
My woman brought children for me
So I can sing them all my songs
And I can tell them stories
most of my boys are with me
Some are still out seeking glory
And some I had to leave behind
My brother I\'m still sorry

Soon I\'ll be 60 years old, my daddy got 61
Remember life and then your life becomes a better one
I made the man so happy when I wrote a letter once

I hope my children come and visit, once or twice a month
Soon I\'ll be 60 years old, will I think the world is cold
Or will I have a lot of children who can bore me
Soon I\'ll be 60 years old
Soon I\'ll be 60 years old, will I think the world is cold

A little less conversation, and
a little more touch my body

Got everyone watchin\' us,

A little bit scandalous,

A little less conversation and
a little more touch my body
Cause I\'m so into you,

Tell me what you came here for
Cause I can\'t, I can\'t wait no more
I\'m on the edge with no control
And I need, I need you to know
You to know, oh

Actually, I treat her regular
Not being seen, we not making no spectacle
Gates had her first then he gave her to Kevin
All the above we do all the et cetera
Scared of the feds, had to switch up my cellular
He talking reckless, don\'t call me back ever

Shout out to Black, shout out to Cedric

Just hollered at Trav, I\'m like the Reverend
My section ridiculous, watch where you steppin\'
Pockets on indigent, can\'t be too careful
Steve like \'em tall and when they yellow
Working in college, fresh with low mileage

What you need that for caressin\' her?
Spreading her legs \'bout to pleasure her
Pulling her hair from the back, go to pressin\' her
Trying to see who tap first, made a bet with her
Relationship flaking, no eczema
She catching feelings, she say we inseparable
Oyster Perpetual, it\'s not a replica
Mustang GT in the streets smoking vegetables
Trunk in the front, do it make me a elephant?
I really really put syrup in my beverages
Shopping in Beverly, check out my etiquette
Loving my swag, women tailor keep checking it
Carats they glisten in all of my necklaces
Feeling myself, really thought it was evident

I\'ve come to talk with you again
Because a vision softly creeping
Left its seeds while I was sleeping
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence

In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone
\'Neath the halo of a street lamp
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more
People talking without speaking
People hearing without listening
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dared
Disturb the sound of silence

"Fools", said I, "You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows
Hear my words that I might teach you
Take my arms that I might reach you"
But my words, like silent raindrops fell
And echoed

In the wells of silence
And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made
And the sign flashed out its warning
In the words that it was forming
And the sign said, "The words of the prophets are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls"
And whispered in the sounds of silence','https://www.musixmatch.com/lyrics/Disturbed/The-Sound-Of-Silence');

They feel the same but they hide it
They just discuss it in private
Don\'t get along man, we tried it
What\'s the point in even trying
I hate a goofy especially
They always dying to mention me
They gonna die out eventually
I could not give you the recipe
You know the game is so separately
Swear I just had an epiphany
It cost me 50 at Tiffany\'s
Shout out to Tiffany, Stephanie
They used to always come check for me
My enemies want to be friends with my other enemies
I don\'t let it get to me

I feed my family with this
So don\'t play with my money this summer i\'m serious
I don\'t run out of material
You shouldn\'t speak on me, period
You try to give \'em your side of the story
They heard it, but they weren\'t hearing it
They feeling the way and won\'t hide it
Niggas done being silent

They got to go, they got to go
They gotta doubt eventually
I cannot give them no empathy

It hurts me every time I see you
Realize how much I need you

Caution tape around my heart
You ever wonder what we could have been?
You said you wouldn\'t and you fucking did
Lie to me, lie with me, get your fucking fix
Now all my drinks and all my feelings are all fucking mixed
Always missing people that I shouldn\'t be missing
Sometimes you gotta burn some bridges just to create some distance
I know that I control my thoughts and I should stop reminiscing
But I learned from my dad that it\'s good to have feelings
When love and trust are gone
I guess this is moving on
Everyone I do right does me wrong

Don\'t make me give you back to the hood

You don\'t wanna fall in love I know
I\'m not someone you should trust I know
I give Chanel out like a hug I know
I do a couple of you friends way before
How many girls have slept in this bed
Say a different number than the one that\'s in my head
Lying to protect you I be doing that a lot
My past check like the Louis you just got
Married in our twenties now, where the fun in that?
My city love me like a college running back
Pack a bag you gon\' end up staying where I\'m at
Took you from the hood, and I could never give you back
I just wanna let you know that someone love you back
All the Cadillac, I\'m gon\' tear this bender back
Whippin\' on this shit I\'m getting ready, where you at?
Riding...

Rode that dick like a soldier
She rode it like a soldier
She rode it like a real marine soldier

Out in the shack with a blue tick hound
Broke as hell, but blessed with beauty
The kind that a rich man can\'t turn down
She caught the eye of an oil man dancing
One summer night in a dime store dress
She had the looks, he had the mansion
And you can figure out the rest

It was all roses, dripping in diamonds
Sipping on champagne
She was all uptown, wearing that white gown
Taking his last name

She could hear those church bells ringing, ringing
And up in the loft, that whole choir singing, singing
Fold your hands and close your eyes
Yeah, it\'s all gonna be alright
And just listen to the church bells ringing, ringing
Yeah, they\'re ringing

Jenny was hosting Junior League parties
And having dinner at the country club
Everyone thought they were Ken and Barbie
But Ken was always getting way too drunk
Saturday night, after a few too many
He came home ready to fight
And all his money could never save Jenny
From the devil living in his eyes

It was all bruises, covered in makeup
Dark sunglasses
And that next morning, sitting in the back pew
Praying with the baptist

She could hear those church bells ringing, ringing
And up in the loft, that whole choir singing, singing
Fold your hands and close your eyes
Yeah, it\'s all gonna be alright
You just listen to the church bells ringing, ringing
Yeah, they\'re ringing

Jenny slipped something in his Tennessee whiskey
No law man was ever gonna find
And how he died is still a mystery
But he hit a woman for the very last time

Standing there in a black dress singing, singing
Fold your hands and close your eyes

To when we had it made
Every Friday night when the sun went down
We\'d be running them streets like we owned the town

And I just can\'t let it go, no, I just can\'t let it go
I wonder if you ever think about it like I do
Seven kids on my two lane road
Had the guns on the radio
After all this time it still feels, feels so good

When I think about those summer nights
Singing out the window, on the back roads, Sweet Child of Mine
Sipping on the local\'s spark of light
Ain\'t it funny how the best days of my life
Was all that wasted time, all that wasted time

Out of nowhere, it slipped away
And the rope by the river hangs silently
And the town that I knew ain\'t nothing like it used to be
Ah, I can\'t explain
They took all the color from the picture frame
And the days got sold to the (?) and the game

And I just can\'t let it go, no, I just can\'t let it go

Was all that wasted time, all that wasted time
Swinging on the line
Living all that wasted time

Hey, hey, now
Summer dresses rained on the hood of the car
Only music that we had was out the left speaker
We were living every second \'til the time ran out
We had nothing but we had it all

When I think about those summer night
Sneaking out the window, running back roads
Your hand in mine
We were going nowhere, we were so alive
Uh huh, ain\'t it funny how the best days of my life

We were swinging out on the line

Doesn\'t matter where I go, I can never get away from it
They give me loyalty and I don\'t gotta pay for it

Begged you to want me
But you didn\'t want to

But piece by piece, he collected me
Up off the ground where you abandoned things
And piece by piece, he filled the holes
That you burned in me at six years old

And no, he never walks away
He never asks for money
He takes care of me
He loves me

Piece by piece, he restored my faith
That a man can be kind and a father could stay

And all of your words fall flat
I need something of myself
And now you wanna come back
But your love, it isn\'t free
It has to be earned
Back then I didn\'t have anything you needed
So I was worthless

But piece by piece, he collected me
Up off the ground where you abandoned things

You don\'t want no problems, want no problems with me, bih!
You don\'t want no problems, want no problems with me
Pull up in the new thing, I\'m like
They be like, "There he go!"


I got problems bigger than these boys
My deposits, they be on steroids
Lord, free the Carter, niggas need the Carter
Sacrificin\' everything, I feel like Jesus Carter
Hold up, I got this sewed up, my soda poured up
My woes up, I\'m flippin\' those bucks, they doing toe tucks
I rolled up and let the smoke puff
I lay down, told yah
Hold up, get too choked up when I think of old stuff
Move on, put my goons on, they kidnap newborns
In the streets my face a coupon
Her pussy too warm
All these bitches come to do harm
Just bought a new charm
Fuck the watch, I buy a new arm, you lukewarm
I\'m Uncle Luke with the hoes
Pretty bitches, centerfolds
Tippy toes around my crib in their robes, just their robes
Half a milli\' in the safe, another in the pillowcase
Codeine got me movin\' slower than a caterpillar race
Fuck wrong with you? What you thinkin\'?
What you thought it was?
I just popped five percocets and only caught a buzz
And if that label try to stop me
There gon\' be some crazy Weezy fans waitin\' in the lobby
Mula, baby


You don\'t want no problems, want no problems with me, bih!
You don\'t want no problems, want no problems with me
Just another day, had to pick up all the mail
There go Chano ridin\' through the streets, they be like, "There he go!"
You don\'t want no problems, want no problems with me, bih!
You don\'t want no problems, want no problems with me
Just another day, had to pick up all the mail
There go Chano ridin\' through the streets, they be like, "There he go!"


You don\'t want no problems, want no problems with me
You don\'t want no problems, want no problems with me
You don\'t want no problems, want no problems with me
You don\'t want no problems, want no problems with me
You don\'t want no problems, want no problems with me
You don\'t want no problems, want no problems with me
Say so, ridin\' with the payo\'
They be like, "There he go!"

I got that sunshine in my pocket
Got that good song in my feet
I feel that hot blood in my body when it drops

Nowhere to hide when I\'m getting you close

So just imagine, just imagine, just imagine
Nothing I can see but you when you dance, dance, dance
Feeling good, good, creeping up on you

Go make yourself some friends or you\'ll be lonely.
Once I was seven years old.

It was a big big world, but we thought we were bigger.
Pushing each other to the limits, we were learning quicker.
By eleven smoking herb and drinking burning liquor
Never rich so we were out to make that steady figure

Once I was eleven years old, my daddy told me
Go get yourself a wife or you\'ll be lonely.
Once I was eleven years old.

I always had that dream like my daddy before me
So I started writing songs, I started writing stories
Something about the glory, just always seemed to bore me
Cause only those I really love will ever really know me

Once I was twenty years old, my story got told
Before the morning sun, when life was lonely.
Once I was twenty years old.

I only see my goals, I don\'t believe in failure.
Cause I know the smallest voices, they can make it major.
I got my boys with me atleast those in favor
And if we don\'t meet before I leave, I hope I\'ll see you later.

Once I was 20 years old, my story got told
I was writing about everything, I saw before me
Once I was 20 years old.

Soon we\'ll be 30 years old, our songs have been sold
We\'ve traveled around the world and we\'re still roaming.
Soon we\'ll be 30 years old.

I\'m still learning about life
My woman brought children for me
So I can sing them all my songs
And I can tell them stories
most of my boys are with me
Some are still out seeking glory
And some I had to leave behind
My brother I\'m still sorry

Soon I\'ll be 60 years old, my daddy got 61
Remember life and then your life becomes a better one
I made the man so happy when I wrote a letter once

I hope my children come and visit, once or twice a month
Soon I\'ll be 60 years old, will I think the world is cold
Or will I have a lot of children who can bore me
Soon I\'ll be 60 years old
Soon I\'ll be 60 years old, will I think the world is cold

Holding something we don\'t need

To teeth and claws and slamming doors at you

Could make me feel right, no, whoa

I just put the key inside my pocket park
It might not get to see, this a new Ferrari
Man in the mirror, how you choose to bother
Someone said they callin\', I don\'t feel like talkin\'
Everything is different returned the way I bought it
Phone be interrupting me while I\'m recordin\'
Phone be making women feel they unimportant
Call my dog, he say it\'s all the way retarded
Keep the [?] cause I am not using the Foreman
Kitchen, I just finished up new performance
Hater, wish you well
I got cliental
I just got it off the scale

I got two phones, one for the plug and one for the load
I got two phones, one for the bitches and one for the dough
Think I need two more, line bumpin\' I\'m ring, ring, ringin\'
Countin\' money while they ring, ring, ringin\'
Trap jumpin\' I\'m ring, ring, ringin\'
I got two phones, one for the plug and one for the load
I got two phones, one for the bitches and one for the dough
Think I need two more, line bumpin\' I\'m ring, ring, ringin\'
Countin\' money while they ring, ring, ringin\'
Trap jumpin\' I\'m ring, ring, ringin\'

There they go again, one of my lil friends
They don\'t give a damn how a nigga been
All they wanna know is what I got to give
How much did I spend? What I got to lend?
What I did and what I didn\'t do for them
Brick comin\' in somewhere on the rim
Section doin\' numbers, nowhere by a gym
Rappin\' bottles spin [?] I\'m supplin\' 10
Jumpin\' out a Honda, I just got it in
Askin\' what I cop, none of your concern
One day you gone learn what you tryna get
Everything on sale, goin\' out of biz
Partners up in jail, gotta feed the kids
Juggin\' round the city, you know what it is
Bread winner business, put that on the wrist

I got two phones, one for the plug and one for the load
I got two phones, one for the bitches and one for the dough
Think I need two more, line bumpin\' I\'m ring, ring, ringin\'
Countin\' money while they ring, ring, ringin\'
Trap jumpin\' I\'m ring, ring, ringin\'

Countin\' money while they ring, ring, ringin\'
Trap jumpin\' I\'m ring, ring, ringin\'

Ring, ring, ringin\' man
Find me balling hard
Come from grinding hard
Getting calling cards from your Barbie doll
When she round me she know I\'m her bodyguard
Money callin\' for me, baby girl I\'m sorry
You just side yelling you not that important
Weight, shape her, pin you to the carpet
Smell like tarter, I\'mma put you in the water
Conversation cause a lot of chips
She don\'t really get a lot of this
Engagin\' where I\'m gazin\' at her hips
And ain\'t nobody makin\' no attempts
Amazing clip, hanging, slanging dick
Maybe we can make it takin\' trips
Maybe I was thinkin\' too impatient
Phone ringing, hold up, what it is?

I got two phones, one for the plug and one for the load
I got two phones, one for the bitches and one for the dough

Buying each other drinks
Back at the bar, thick as thieves
Stealing these little sips
Doing our best to make the best of the worst of it

keep singing along
Keep leaning it on in closer
Keep salting the rim, getting even with her
Gettin\' even with him before the night is over

You better keep on keeping it lit

Can\'t remember why we came here to forget...

Nobody\'s ex is texting for a rewind

Falling in love just enough to get us through

It won\'t be a waste of time
Always stay humble and kind

Hold the door say please say thank you
Don\'t steal don\'t cheat and don\'t lie
I know you got moutains to climb but
Always stay humble and kind

When the dreams you\'re dreamin come to you
When the work you put in is realized
Let yourself feel the pride but
Always stay humble and kind

Don\'t expect a free ride from no one
Don\'t hold a grudge or a chip and here\'s why
Bitterness keeps you from flying
Always stay humble and kind

Know the difference between sleeping with someone
And sleeping with someone you love
"I love you" ain\'t no pick up line so
Always stay humble and kind

Hold the door say please say thank you
Don\'t steal don\'t cheat and don\'t lie
I know you got mountains to climb but
Always stay humble and kind

When those dreams you\'re dreamin come to you
When the work you put in is realized
Let yourself feel the pride but
Always stay humble and kind
When it\'s hot eat a root beer popsicle
Shut off the A/C and roll the windows down
Let that summer sun shine
Always stay humble and kind

Don\'t take for granted the love this life gives you
When you get where you\'re goin\'
Don\'t forget turn back around
Help the next one in line
Always stay humble and kind','https://www.musixmatch.com/lyrics/Tim-McGraw/Humble-And-Kind');

Real T-way!

Yeah
I pull up in Lexus\' like it\'s \'07
I just hit a lick
I got to hit a next one
Last year I know you learned your lesson
I could GPS you if you need some addressing
Boss up, I\'m the bigger homie
But I\'m one year older than my lil homie
\'09 they were bidding on me
But I\'m young money, got it written on me
Ok now we got some action
Everything I said, it happened
That boy light as Michael Jackson
But off verses, he been blackin\'
Chasing women a distraction
They want to be on TV right next to me
You cannot be right here next to me
Don\'t you see Riri right next to me?
I hate a rapper especially
They feel the same but they hide it
They just discuss it in private
Don\'t get along man, we tried it
What\'s the point in even trying
I hate a goofy especially
They always dying to mention me
They gonna die out eventually
I could not give you the recipe
You know the game is so separately
Swear I just had an epiphany
It cost me 50 at Tiffany\'s
Shout out to Tiffany, Stephanie
They used to always come check for me
My enemies want to be friends with my other enemies
I don\'t let it get to me

Done
Look what I\'ve done in my life
I had to count it and count it again
To make sure the money was right
They love to talk
Me, I\'m just done in the hype
Me, I\'m just done in the hype
Me I\'m just done, done, done, done, done

I don\'t take this shit for granted
I do my own propaganda
I feel like Juelz Santana
Leg hangin\' out the Phantom
6 cold like Alaska
VIEWS already a classic
Roy outta here like NASA
Bustin\' 1\'s out the plastic
A gram, two poppin\' to fuck her
The chain too heavy to tuck it, I\'m serious
I feed my family with this
So don\'t play with my money this summer i\'m serious
I don\'t run out of material
You shouldn\'t speak on me, period
You try to give \'em your side of the story
They heard it, but they weren\'t hearing it
They feeling the way and won\'t hide it
Niggas done being silent
Don\'t get along man, we tried it
What\'s the point of even trying
I hate a goofy especially
They always dying to mention me
They got to go, they got to go
They gotta doubt eventually
I cannot give them no empathy
I\'mma have [?] when I\'m at 70
They cannot fuck with my legacy
I don\'t know what else is left for me
After this there\'s no one to threaten me
My enemies want to be friends with my other enemies
I don\'t let it get to me

I\'ve come to talk with you again
Because a vision softly creeping
Left its seeds while I was sleeping
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence

In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone
\'Neath the halo of a street lamp
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more
People talking without speaking
People hearing without listening
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dared
Disturb the sound of silence

"Fools", said I, "You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows
Hear my words that I might teach you
Take my arms that I might reach you"
But my words, like silent raindrops fell
And echoed

In the wells of silence
And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made
And the sign flashed out its warning
In the words that it was forming
And the sign said, "The words of the prophets are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls"
And whispered in the sounds of silence','https://www.musixmatch.com/lyrics/Disturbed/The-Sound-Of-Silence');

Lying to protect you I be doing that a lot

Married in our twenties now, where the fun in that?
My city love me like a college running back
Pack a bag you gon\' end up staying where I\'m at
Took you from the hood, and I could never give you back
I just wanna let you know that someone love you back
All the Cadillac, I\'m gon\' tear this bender back

But I\'m
Still missing you
And I can\'t
See the end of this
Just wanna feel your kiss
Against my lips
And now all this time
Is passing by
But I still can\'t seem to tell you why
It hurts me every time I see you
Realize how much I need you

I hate you I love you
I hate that I love you
Don\'t want to, but I can\'t put
Nobody else above you
I hate you I love you
I hate that I want you
You want her, you need her
And I\'ll never be her

I miss you when I can\'t sleep
Or right after coffee
Or right when I can\'t eat
I miss you in my front seat
Still got sand in my sweaters
From nights we don\'t remember
Do you miss me like I miss you?
Fucked around and got attached to you
Friends can break your heart too, and
I\'m always tired but never of you
If I pulled a you on you, you wouldn\'t like that shit
I put this reel out, but you wouldn\'t bite that shit
I type a text but then I nevermind that shit
I got these feelings but you never mind that shit
Oh oh, keep it on the low
You\'re still in love with me but your friends don\'t know
If u wanted me you would just say so
And if I were you, I would never let me go

I hate you I love you
I hate that I love you
Don\'t want to, but I can\'t put
Nobody else above you
I hate you I love you
I hate that I want you
You want her, you need her
And I\'ll never be her

I don\'t mean no harm
I just miss you on my arm
Wedding bells were just alarms
Caution tape around my heart
You ever wonder what we could have been?
You said you wouldn\'t and you fucking did
Lie to me, lie with me, get your fucking fix
Now all my drinks and all my feelings are all fucking mixed
Always missing people that I shouldn\'t be missing
Sometimes you gotta burn some bridges just to create some distance
I know that I control my thoughts and I should stop reminiscing
But I learned from my dad that it\'s good to have feelings
When love and trust are gone
I guess this is moving on
Everyone I do right does me wrong
So every lonely night, I sing this song

I hate you I love you
I hate that I love you
Don\'t want to, but I can\'t put
Nobody else above you
I hate you I love you
I hate that I want you
You want her, you need her
And I\'ll never be her

All alone I watch you watch her
Like she\'s the only girl you\'ve ever seen
You don\'t care you never did
You don\'t give a damn about me
Yeah all alone I watch you watch her
She\'s the only thing you\'ve ever seen
How is it you never notice
That you are slowly killing me

I hate you I love you
I hate that I love you
Don\'t want to, but I can\'t put
Nobody else above you
I hate you I love you

Hotter than a ring of fire

Seven kids on my two lane road
Had the guns on the radio
After all this time it still feels, feels so good

When I think about those summer nights
Singing out the window, on the back roads, Sweet Child of Mine
Sipping on the local\'s spark of light
Ain\'t it funny how the best days of my life
Was all that wasted time, all that wasted time

Out of nowhere, it slipped away
And the rope by the river hangs silently
And the town that I knew ain\'t nothing like it used to be
Ah, I can\'t explain
They took all the color from the picture frame
And the days got sold to the (?) and the game

And I just can\'t let it go, no, I just can\'t let it go

Swinging on the line
Living all that wasted time

Hey, hey, now
Summer dresses rained on the hood of the car
Only music that we had was out the left speaker
We were living every second \'til the time ran out
We had nothing but we had it all

When I think about those summer night
Sneaking out the window, running back roads
Your hand in mine
We were going nowhere, we were so alive
Uh huh, ain\'t it funny how the best days of my life
Was all that wasted time, all that wasted time
We were swinging out on the line
Living all that wasted time

Hey, you know oh

Better than \'em telling me the check\'s no good
Now they wanna act like I do no good
Funny cause I really did more than I should
I made a decision last night that I would die for it
Just to show the city what it takes to be alive for it
Can\'t get me on the line so they hang me out to dry for it
You know 40 wants peace, but I\'m down to cut ties for it
And I can\'t sleep these days unless I take one
If they don\'t have a story these days, they\'ll make one
Life is always on, man, I never get a break from it
Doesn\'t matter where I go, I can never get away from it
They give me loyalty and I don\'t gotta pay for it
Same way, breads gotta break for it
Keeping people fed is my only peace of mind now

Just to get close to you
Can we burn something babe
And I run for miles just to get a taste

Begged you to want me
But you didn\'t want to

Up off the ground where you abandoned things
And piece by piece, he filled the holes
That you burned in me at six years old

And no, he never walks away
He never asks for money
He takes care of me
He loves me

Piece by piece, he restored my faith
That a man can be kind and a father could stay

And all of your words fall flat
I need something of myself
And now you wanna come back
But your love, it isn\'t free
It has to be earned
Back then I didn\'t have anything you needed
So I was worthless

Because unlike you I\'m gonna put her first

He\'ll never break her heart
He\'ll take care of things
He\'ll love her

Tellin\' you guys how I feel man...

When you wake up in the mornin\', ayy
Mom\'s yellin\' in your room
Like can I get 5 more minutes?
Shit, I ain\'t really trippin\' over school
Let\'s get Wiz Khalifa high and
Get meditated over medicated

Get Wiz Khalifa high and

I told moms I ain\'t trippin\' over school cause I made it
Said, "Boy you got a son, supposed to be his inspiration"
Put a milli\' in his bank account, don\'t leave him, I was thinkin\'
I\'ll never do him wrong like they did the operation
Took the nigga\'s vision from him, was a mothafuckin\' baby
Said a couple years later they could give him back to me
Technology is movin\' too slow, I\'m waitin\' patiently
Shit, I don\'t want it no more, this how I\'m meant to be
Remember young kids in the school used to laugh at him
Guess I played my numbers real good, check the mathematics
Nigga brought the Zoovie Zoo up, why they mad at him?
Man I bought about 12 cars just to blast past
Switch cars so much, don\'t know which one to blast at
And my bitch so bad and you know her ass fat
Wanna ride through, man, ayy, Zoo\'ll laugh at
Zoo Gang my crew, won\'t put nothin\' past that

I want a ticket to anywhere
Maybe we make a deal
Maybe together we can get somewhere
Any place is better
Starting from zero, got nothing to lose
Maybe we\'ll make something
Me, myself, I got nothing to prove

You got a fast car
And I got a plan to get us out of here
I\'ve been working at a convenience store
Managed to save just a little bit of money
We won\'t have to drive too far
Just across the border and into the city
You and I can both get jobs
And finally see what it means to be living

You got a fast car
Is it fast enough so we can fly away?
We gotta make a decision
We leave tonight or live and die this way

So I remember we were driving, driving in your car
The speed so fast, I felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us
And your arm felt nice wrapped \'round my shoulder
And I, I had a feeling that I belonged
And I, I had a feeling that I could be someone
Had a feeling that I could be someone

You see, my old man\'s got a problem
He lives by the bottle, that\'s the way it is
He says his body\'s too old for working
His body\'s too young to look like his
My mama went off and left him
She wanted more from life than he could give
I said, somebody\'s got to take care of him
So I quit school and that\'s what I did

You got a fast car
And we go cruising to entertain ourselves
You still ain\'t got a job
And I work in a market as a checkout girl
I know things will get better
You\'ll find work and I\'ll get promoted
We\'ll move out of the shelter
Buy a bigger house and live in the suburbs

You got a fast car
Is it fast enough so we can fly away?
You gotta make a decision
We leave tonight or live and die this way
