General Ideas: Music Lyrics and NLP
Main issue: Show me the money!

Possible links- obviously, recommendation algorithm, find songs with similar lyrics

Business questions: What single from a record should we release? 
Where to advertise for concerts, records, etc?
What songs should a radio station play at a particular time? Is ratings information available? Do factors like weather, holiday, the economy, time of day, etc matter?
Most of the effect of music comes without the lyrics.

Promotions- reaching the appropriate audience with concerts, parties, promotional appearances, etc?
Does music correlate with political unrest? Data from SPEED 
Sentiment

WHERE IS THE MONEY?
Predict what the markup on a given ticket would be- look at past concerts from the same or similar artists, geographical, economic conditions, weather?
