General Ideas: Music Lyrics and NLP
Main issue: Show me the money!

PIVOT: Predict billboard ratings from song lyrics

Now I can get lyrics! Next step - write a method.
Then, I will need to put hte lyrics into nltk and try to do parts of speech classification, and build a rhyme scheme structure.
tomorrow: put words into nltk, try to analyze parts of speech. maybe get to rhymes?

# Post Check-In: An automatic parody generator. 
Input a song title and a topic, search for the lyrics and replace them with relevant words.
Potential pitfalls: how to validate?


Possible links- obviously, recommendation algorithm, find songs with similar lyrics

Business questions: What single from a record should we release? 
Where to advertise for concerts, records, etc?
What songs should a radio station play at a particular time? (Is ratings information publically available?) Do factors like weather, holiday, the economy, time of day, etc matter?
Most of the effect of music comes without the lyrics. Does certain music encourage buying behavior? Employee satisfaction? 

Promotions- reaching the appropriate audience with concerts, parties, promotional appearances, etc?
Does music correlate with political unrest? Data from SPEED vs Sentiment

WHERE IS THE MONEY?
Predict what the markup on a given ticket would be- look at past concerts from the same or similar artists, geographical, economic conditions, weather?
